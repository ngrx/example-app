#@ngrx example application

Example application utilizing @ngrx libraries, showcasing common patterns and best practices. You can find the live app [here](http://ngrx.github.io/example-app/).

This app is a book collection manager. Using the Google Books API, the user can search for books and add them to their collection. This application utilizes [@ngrx/db](https://github.com/ngrx/db) to persist the collection across sessions; [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) to manage the state of the app and to cache requests made to the Google Books API; [@angular/router](https://github.com/angular/angular) to manage navigation between routes; and [@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) to isolate side effects.
